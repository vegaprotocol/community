**First, familiarise yourself with the [Vega Font Competition on the Vega Forums](https://community.vega.xyz/t/the-vega-sticker-competition-16th-nov-8th-dec/3824)**

# GitHub Instructions
1. Make sure to [create a GitHub account](https://github.com/) if you do not have one already.
2. Anyone wishing to add their stickers to this repository (vega_sticker_competition_entries) can [fork it](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo) and [create a Pull Request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork) which will get reviewed by the community members and merged into the 'main' branch.
3. Make sure that you submit the stickers one by one and that each individual entry is named "[Vega Forum Username] - [Sticker Name]". For example: "_Daig - Hixel_1_". This will allow us to identify your submission and reward you if you win a prize.

*We understand that not everyone is familar with GitHub and we wouldn't like that to become an obstacle to adding your works here, so if that's the case please reach out on [Discord](https://vega.xyz/discord) and other community memebers will gladly give you a hand.
